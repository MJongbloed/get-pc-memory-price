    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 03/31/2025</p>

    <p>Hey there! Welcome to pcmemoryfinder.com. I know privacy policies can be as exciting as watching paint dry, but I promise to keep this short, sweet, and maybe even a little entertaining.</p>

    <h3>1. Analytics and Tracking</h3>
    <p>I use <a href="https://matomo.org/" target="_blank">Matomo</a> to keep an eye on my website traffic (but not in a creepy way). Here's how I do it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No cookies:</strong> I won't sneak cookies onto your device—if you want cookies, I suggest a bakery.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized IP addresses:</strong> Your IP address is scrambled like a secret agent's identity before I store it.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized referrer data:</strong> If you came here from another website, I don't really know who sent you—just that you arrived. Like a surprise party, but less surprising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Affiliate Links</h3>
    <p>I'm part of the Amazon Affiliate Program, which means if you click on an Amazon link and buy something, I may get a tiny commission (at no extra cost to you!). Amazon might set cookies because, well, they like knowing where their customers come from. But that's on them, not me!</p>

    <h3>3. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
    <p>I do not collect your personal info unless you hand it over willingly (like filling out a contact form). I use any data I collect just to make this site better, not to stalk you.</p>

    <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>I don't sell or share your data with shady third parties. Actually, I don't share it with anyone unless we absolutely have to (like if the law says so).</p>

    <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request access to, correct, or delete any data I may have collected about you. Just shoot me an email at <span class="email">info@accentio.nl</span>, and I'll take care of it—no long, boring forms required.</p>

    <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>I might update this policy now and then. If anything major changes, I'll probably make an announcement (or at least not hide it in tiny text).</p>

    <p>Questions? Concerns? Just want to say hi? Drop me a line at <span class="email">michel@accentio.nl</span>!</p>
