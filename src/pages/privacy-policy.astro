        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 04/07/2025</p>

        <p>Hey there! Welcome to pcmemoryfinder.com. I know privacy policies can be as exciting as watching paint dry, but I promise to keep this short, sweet, and maybe even a little entertaining.</p>

        <h3>1. Analytics and Tracking</h3>
        <p>I use PostHog analytics to understand how visitors interact with my single-page site (but not in a creepy way). PostHog helps me understand how visitors scroll, click, and use the site.</p>

        <h4>How it works:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> PostHog uses browser local storage to understand how the page is used, minimizing the use of cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>What's collected:</strong> Basic information like your (anonymized) IP address, browser type, device info, time spent on the page, and interaction patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> PostHog is configured with privacy-friendly settings, including secure storage and no cross-domain tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>No personal identifiers:</strong> I don't collect or store any personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li><strong>Opting out:</strong> You can opt out of tracking by using your browser's "Do Not Track" setting or by using privacy-focused browser extensions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Affiliate Links</h3>
        <p>I'm part of the Amazon Affiliate Program, which means if you click on an Amazon link and buy something, I may get a tiny commission (at no extra cost to you!). Amazon might set cookies because, well, they like knowing where their customers come from. But that's on them, not me!</p>

        <h3>3. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
        <p>I do not collect your personal info unless you hand it over willingly (like filling out a contact form). I use any data I collect just to make this site better, not to stalk you.</p>

        <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>I don't sell or share your data with shady third parties. Actually, I don't share it with anyone unless we absolutely have to (like if the law says so).</p>

        <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request access to, correct, or delete any data I may have collected about you. Just shoot me an email at <span class="email">info@accentio.nl</span>, and I'll take care of itâ€”no long, boring forms required.</p>

        <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>I might update this policy now and then. If anything major changes, I'll probably make an announcement (or at least not hide it in tiny text).</p>

        <p>Questions? Concerns? Just want to say hi? Drop me a line at <span class="email">michel@accentio.nl</span>!</p>
