# Do lower CAS Latency numbers really make your PC faster?

![Cas Latency Explained](/images/cas-latency-explained.png)

If you've ever tried to upgrade your RAM or build a gaming PC, you've probably come across the term **CAS Latency**. But what is CAS Latency in computer memory, and should you really care?

Stick around, because this post will break down **CAS Latency** in simple terms, help you understand whether a lower number actually matters, and show you how it compares to RAM speed. You’ll also learn the **best CAS Latency for gaming**, and how to make smarter buying decisions.

This blog is especially helpful for **PC gamers, system builders, tech enthusiasts**, and even casual users who want to get the most out of their hardware.

My name is Michel Jongbloed, and after years of researching, benchmarking, and working with performance-based PC hardware, I’ve learned what specs actually matter—and which ones are just marketing fluff.

In this post, we’ll cover:
- What CAS Latency means and how it works.
- Whether a lower CAS Latency truly boosts performance.
- How to compare **RAM speed vs CAS Latency**.
- Tips on **how to lower CAS Latency**.
- The **good CAS Latency for DDR5** RAM modules.
- And finally, how to pick RAM using a tool like [pcmemoryfinder.com](https://pcmemoryfinder.com), to ensure the best price-to-performance ratio.

## What is CAS Latency in computer memory?

**CAS Latency (Column Address Strobe Latency)** is the delay time between the moment a memory controller tells the RAM to access a specific memory column and the moment the data is available.

Think of it like asking a librarian to fetch a book from a shelf. The time it takes her to locate and hand it to you—that’s your CAS Latency.

So, when your RAM has a CAS Latency of 16, it means it takes 16 clock cycles to complete that operation. Lower numbers mean less waiting time.

## Is lower CAS Latency better?

Yes, in most cases, **a lower CAS Latency is better**—but only when you compare RAM modules with the same clock speed.

CAS Latency alone doesn’t determine the speed. It must be looked at **relative to the memory frequency**. A RAM stick with CAS 16 at 3200 MHz might perform similarly to CAS 18 at 3600 MHz.

In short: **lower latency is good**, but only in combination with a strong frequency.

## RAM Speed vs CAS Latency: What matters more?

To truly understand performance, you have to consider **RAM speed vs CAS Latency** together.

Use this simple formula to calculate **true latency in nanoseconds**:

**Latency (ns) = (CAS Latency / RAM Speed in MHz) × 2000**

For example:
- DDR4-3200 CL16: (16 / 3200) × 2000 = **10 ns**
- DDR4-3600 CL18: (18 / 3600) × 2000 = **10 ns**

In this case, they perform nearly identically in terms of real latency.

## Best CAS Latency for gaming

If you’re building a gaming rig, **timing and frequency both matter**, but the difference in CAS Latency only impacts performance slightly in most modern games.

For gaming:
- DDR4 RAM: CL14 to CL16 at 3200–3600 MHz is great.
- DDR5 RAM: A **good CAS Latency for DDR5** is CL30 to CL36 at 5200–6000 MHz.

Ultimately, faster frequency matters more for high-FPS gaming, but lower CAS still gives an edge in **frame time consistency** and loading speeds.

## How to lower CAS Latency

Wondering **how to lower CAS Latency** manually? Here’s how:

1. **Enter your BIOS/UEFI settings.**
2. Locate the memory timing configuration.
3. Reduce the CAS Latency value in small steps.
4. **Stress test your system** using tools like MemTest86 or Prime95.

Note 1: This is called **memory timing tuning** and may require voltage adjustments. Do it only if you're comfortable with overclocking principles.
Note 2: Check this article out on [how to adjust RAM settings in you computer BIOS](https://www.blackview.hk/blog/computers/how-to-change-ram-speed-in-bios)

## Choosing RAM with great CAS Latency

Instead of digging through spec sheets, just head over to [pcmemoryfinder.com](https://pcmemoryfinder.com) and use their filtering tools.

You can filter by **CAS Latency**, memory type (DDR4, DDR5), capacity, speed, form factor, and even **price per GB**. It’s a time-saving way to find high-performance RAM that fits your needs—and your budget.

## Final Thoughts: Should you care about CAS Latency?

Yes, but **don’t obsess over it**. Lower CAS Latency can improve real-world responsiveness and multitasking, especially if you’re tuning a high-end build. But if you’re gaming or using general applications, **frequency and capacity** often have a greater impact.

The sweet spot is balanced RAM: good speed, **reasonable CAS Latency**, and a decent price.
