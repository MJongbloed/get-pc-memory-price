## Why Upgrade Your PC's RAM?

Upgrading RAM improves your computer's ability to handle more tasks at once. You'll notice:

- Faster response times when switching programs
- Improved performance in games or creative applications
- Less lag when multitasking

If your PC struggles with basic tasks or loads slowly, it may be time to install memory in your PC.

## Step 1: Check What RAM Your System Supports

Before buying RAM, you'll need to identify what your motherboard supports.

**Here's how to check:**

- Look up your **motherboard model** and see whether it supports **DDR3, DDR4, or DDR5**.
- Confirm the **maximum RAM capacity** (e.g., 32GB, 64GB).
- Identify how many **RAM slots** you have (usually 2 or 4).

You can use tools like [PCMemoryFinder.com](https://pcmemoryfinder.com/) to search for compatible RAM by brand, price per GB, form factor (DIMM or SO-DIMM), memory speed, and more. This makes it easy to find upgrade options that will work for your machine.

## Step 2: Power Down and Prepare

Safety first. Here's what to do before installing:

1. Shut down your PC and unplug all cables.
2. Press the power button for 5–10 seconds to discharge static electricity.
3. Open the case using a screwdriver (most towers have screws at the back).
4. Wear an anti-static wrist strap or ground yourself by touching a grounded metal surface.

---

## Step 3: Locate and Remove Existing RAM (If Needed)

Look for the **RAM slots** — usually near the CPU cooler. If you need to remove old RAM:

- Push down both clips on the sides of the slot — the RAM module will pop up slightly.
- Gently pull the module out from the slot.

---

## Step 4: Install the New RAM

Follow these steps to install memory in PC slots:

1. Line up the notch on the RAM module with the ridge in the RAM slot.
2. Insert the module into the slot at a straight angle.
3. Press down evenly on both ends until the clips click into place.

**Tip**: If your motherboard supports dual-channel, install matched RAM sticks in the correct slots (often marked in color pairs like DIMM A1/A2 or B1/B2).

---

## Step 5: Reassemble and Power On

1. Close your PC case and screw the panel back on.
2. Reconnect the power cord and peripherals.
3. Power on the PC.

If everything was installed correctly, the system should boot normally.

---

## Step 6: Verify RAM Installation

You'll want to confirm that your new memory is recognized.

### On Windows:

- Open the File Explorer
- Right-click on **This PC** → **Properties**
- Check **Installed RAM** under **System** → **About** → "Device specifications"

Or:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager
- Click on the **Performance** tab → **Memory**

If you don't see the correct amount, check that the modules are seated correctly and consult your motherboard manual for slot configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

If the system doesn't boot or you hear beeping:

- Reseat the RAM modules.
- Check for dust or misalignment.
- Verify module compatibility.

For additional help, check your motherboard's error codes or user manual.
